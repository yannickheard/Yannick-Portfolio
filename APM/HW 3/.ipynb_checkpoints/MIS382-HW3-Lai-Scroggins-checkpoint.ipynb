    "1. Using stochastic gradient descent, derive the coefficent updates for all 4 coefficients of the model: $$ y = w_0 + w_1*x_1 + w_2*x_1*x_2 + w_3*x_2 $$ Hint: start from the cost function (Assume sum of squared error). If you write the math by hand, submit that as a separate file and make a reference to it in your notebook or include the image in your notebook.\n",
    "2. Write Python code for an SGD solution to the non-linear model $$ y = w_0 + w_1*x_1 + w_2*x_1*x_2 + w_3*x_2$$ Try to format similarly to scikit-learn's models. Your class should take as input the learning_rate, regularization_constant and number of epochs. The fit method must take as input X,y and a choice of update_rule as 'SGD' or 'adagrad' (Notes on implementation below). The _predict_ method takes an X value (optionally, an array of values). Use your new gradient descent regression to predict the data given in 'samples.csv', for 10 epochs, using learning rates: [.0001, .001, .01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100] and regularization constants in the range: [0,10,100] . Plot MSE and the $w$ parameters as a function of epoch count (10 epochs) for the best 2 combinations of learning_rate and regularization for both SGD and Adagrad. ie you should have 2 plots of MSE and parameter updates for SGD and adagrad each. Report the MSE at the end of 10 epochs for all 4 combinations.\n",

    "Adagrad (http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) differs from vanilla SGD in that the learning rate of each weight changes over updates. A cache is maintained that holds the sum of squares of all gradients upto the current update. The learning_rate is divided by the cache, resulting in a different learning rate for each weight. A consequence of this update rule is that weights that have already seen large gradients (made large jumps) make smaller updates in subsequent iterations.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Question2_Partii_8neurons.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 250px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In comparing the four screenshots and scenarios, we are able to see that the losses returned by the TensorFlow runs become smaller as we add more neurons to the first hidden layer. 8 neurons returns a 0.012 test loss vs. 1 neuron returning 0.046 test loss under similar conditions. This was also the case for the training loss.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It is also noticeable that we see convergence more quickly as well with a larger number of neurons. The run with 3 neurons was much more unstable originally when looking at the losses coverge. With lesser number of neurons, we see an immediate steep drop but a slower rate of convergence when compared to runs with more neurons in the first hidden layer.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1 and 2 neuron selections did not resemble the shape of the original selection well, whereas the shapes were more well defined as we increased the number of neurons. In general, with a higher number of neurons, we would likely see a more accurate regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii) Now keeping learning rate at 0.03 and running with 200 epochs and other default values, checking output for various activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for the activation function ReLU: \n",

    "For the activation function Linear:\n",
    "</n>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Question2_Partiii_Linear.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 250px;\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In comparing these four screenshots and scenarios, we are able to see that Tanh returns the lowest test and train losses, followed by ReLU, Sigmoid, and Linear. Some items to note were that ReLU also showed a strong accuracy in the separating the blues and oranges. Sigmoid had a quick drop when running the epochs that resulted in a sharp decline in losses and clearly defined clusters of blues and oranges. Tanh had a steady decline in losses throughout the number of epochs. Linear resulted in a quick drop in losses and then no change through most of the latter epochs.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on parts ii) and iii) to Part A, we can deduce that a higher number of neurons and a choice of tanh as the choice of activation function could potentially minimize our test and train losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing the test loss and train loss under various scenarios where the tuning parameters are changed, we see the following results:\n",

    "First, for 2 inputs and varied parameters:\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Question2_PartB_7inputs.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 2000px;\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases presented above, we chose to use the maximum number of neurons for each layer. In Sub-Part ii) of the earlier Part A, we were able to see that a higher number of neurons resulted in a lower test and training loss. Furthermore, the ReLU activation function seemed to be more accurate in classifying blues and oranges. Additional parameters were not modified, such as learning rate, set to the standard value of 0.03 for computational time benefits. With no noise, there would not be a huge perceived benefit in adding many additional hidden layers, so 3 and 2 hidden layers were chosen, respectively.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Numerically, we see that using 7 inputs produces a lower test and train loss as compared to 2 inputs. With the additional inputs, we would expect a higher classification accuracy. It is notable that both test losses are around 0.03 and training losses around 0.004 - therefore we can see that the model is slightly overfitted. However, the losses have still been fairly minimized without overthinking the problem, and by using the concepts described earlier, these were the optimal results given what we know about each individual tuning parameter."
