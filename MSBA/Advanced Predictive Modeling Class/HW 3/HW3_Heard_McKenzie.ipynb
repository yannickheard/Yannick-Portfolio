A cache is maintained that holds the sum of squares of all gradients upto the current update. The learning_rate is divided by the cache, resulting in a different learning rate for each weight. A consequence of this update rule is that weights that have already seen large gradients (made large jumps) make smaller updates in subsequent iterations.\n",

    "Adagrad allows a larger initial setting of the learning rate. The cache method of updating the learning rate means that weights that have already seen large gradients, and made large jumps, make smaller updates in subsequent iterations. This means the Adagrad method is less likely to diverge by 'bouncing' out of a minimum due to too large of a learning rate, as the rate will adapt instead of letting the error bounce up the weight surface to infinity, as regular SGD does.\n",
    "2. What would a drawback of adagrad be? How could this be fixed? (Hint: Adadelta)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adagrad accumulates squared gradients, which are always postiive. This means the sum keeps growing during training, regardless of how close or far away the surace is from a minimum. Since Adagrad divides the learning rate by the cache, this can cause the learning rate to shrink to zero, preventing the algorithm from moving along the error surface at all. Adadelta restricts the window of accumulated past gradients to some fixed size, thus preventing the learning rate from going to zero.  "

    "In this problem, you will model the data using decision trees to perform a classification task. Load the BreastTissue.csv dataset. The dataset has been preprocessed. The description of the dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Tissue). Using the class tree.DecisionTreeClassifier (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.tree), build two different trees with a maximum depth of two using the split criteria (i) Gini and (ii) Entropy. Use all the data to build trees. Plot the two trees. If your classifier object is called clf, use the following commands to save the generated tree as a '.dot' file that can be used to visualize the tree using Webgraphviz: http://www.webgraphviz.com/\n",
